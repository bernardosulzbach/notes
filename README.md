## Missing credits
If you would like me to give you credits, open an issue or send me an e-mail.
Similarly, if you want me to remove something because it is yours and you will
not let me use it even if I credit your work, open an issue or send me an
e-mail.

I may **not** give you credits or remove the content if I conclude that you are
not the owner of the content.

## Building
See the `.travis.yml` file of a snapshot to understand how a given version is
built.

Since Release 16 there is a script called `install-required-packages.sh` that
should install all needed packages in a Debian-based distribution.
